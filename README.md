# textViz
TextViz is an online system that analyzes a userâ€™s text messages and provides interactive feedback.

To run:

2. Download the following modules in a virtual environment:
-- Django
-- sckit-learn
-- plotly
-- numpy
-- nltk (all packages)

3. Enter the textViz directory (the folder that has manage.py in it) from your command line with the virtual env. activated and run: manage.py runserver.
Copy the displayed address and access from your browser.
Note: Depending on your system, you may have to append python before the 'manage.py runserver' command.

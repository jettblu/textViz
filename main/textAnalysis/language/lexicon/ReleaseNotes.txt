DataSet: IBM Debater(R) - Sentiment Composition Lexicons

The dataset contains:
1. Sentiment composition lexicons containing 2,783 words.
2. Sentiment lexicons containing 66,058 unigrams and 262,555 bigrams.

Please cite this paper if you use the dataset.

The dataset includes:
1. ReleaseNotes.docx - release notes file describing the data
2. SEMANTIC_CLASSES.xlsx - the composition lexicons for reversers, propagators, and dominators
3. ADJECTIVES.xlsx - the composition lexicons for two gradable adjective pairs (high-low, fast-slow) and their expansion list  
4. LEXICON_UG.txt - the unigrams sentiment lexicon
5. LEXICON_BG.txt - the bigrams sentiment lexicon

Detailed description of the data:
SEMANTIC_CLASSES.xlsx 
This file contains the lists of the semantic classes words for each type. 
For each semantic class (reversers, propagators, and dominators) there are two tabs in the Excel file, 
one for a positive composition (POS) and one for negative composition (NEG). 
Overall there are 6 tabs: DOMINATOR_NEG, DOMINATOR_POS, PROPAGETOR_POS, PROPAGETOR_NEG, REVERSER_POS, REVERSER_NEG.

ADJECTIVES.xlsx
This file contains the lists of the semantic classes words for the gradable adjective pairs.
(HIGH,LOW)_POS_NEG, (HIGH,LOW)_NEG_POS: the lists of words for ADJ high/low.
(FAST,SLOW)_POS_NEG, (FAST,SLOW)_NEG_POS: the lists of words for ADJ fast/slow.
ADJECTIVE_EXPANSION: the list of adjective expansions for high, low, fast, slow.

LEXICON_UG.txt
A list of 66058 unigrams and their predicted sentiment score. 
Note that in the paper, for unigrams that have sentiment in the HL lexicon (the publicly-available 
sentiment lexicon of Hu and Liu (2004)), we used the original sentiment from the HL lexicon (+1 or -1) 
and not the predicted score. This step is not reflected in the released lexicon. 

LEXICON_BG.txt
A list of 262555 selected bigrams in the following format:
	Column 1: the bigram
	Column 2: the OpenNLP POS tags of its unigrams
	Column 3: the predicted sentiment score
